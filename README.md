Thanks to them for providing a framework for using GitHub as a class collaboration tool and for insights into teaching programming skills.

## Course description ##

Data science is a rapidly developing field that combines the recent Big Data revolution with ever-developing statistical algorithms to inform business and policy decisions. Nearly every company you've heard of uses data science to optimize its services: Netflix uses it to recommend new programs to its viewers, Amazon uses it to determine how much it should charge for its Prime services. This class will provide students with an overview of the data science workflow, from collecting raw data to drawing a set of insights from which a decision maker can make informed decisions. Along the way we will broadly cover a variety of advances in data collection, data storage, visualization, machine learning and econometrics topics, as well as teaching and reinforcing good programming practices. The primary goal of this course is to provide you, the student, with a set of skills that will allow you to compete for a data science job.

## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes ##

By the end of the course, students should be able to do the following:

1. Explain the data science workflow from start to finish
2. Be able to collect data from online sources via APIs or scraping
3. Describe similarities and differences between econometrics and machine learning
4. Explain what data science is, and how Big Data differs from other types of data
5. Demonstrate good programming practices by writing code that can allow for easy collaboration with others
6. Understand the differences between prediction and causality, and the cases in which each is useful

In this course students, through lecture and application, will learn about:
* Good programming practices, including how to write code collaboratively with others

## Grades ##

Grades will be based on the categories listed below with the corresponding weights.

Component                    |   Percent  |
-----------------------------|------------|
Class Participation          |    10%     |
Problem Sets                 |    35%     |
Exam & Quizzes               |    20%     |
Final project                |    35%     |
**Total points**             |  **100%**  |

Final grades will be assigned according to the standard cutoffs (90%+ for an A, 80%-89.99% for a B, etc.).

* **Participation:**
    * An important part of learning is face-to-face interaction. Thus, some of your grade will depend on attendance and active participation in class meetings.
* **Problem sets:** will be assigned approximately weekly throughout the semester.
    * You must write and submit your own computer code, although I encourage you to collaborate with your fellow students. I **DO NOT** want to see a bunch of copies of identical code. I **DO** want to see each of you learning how to code these problems so that you could do it on your own.
    * Problem set solutions, both written and code portions, will be turned in via a pull request from your private [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) repository which is a fork of the class master repository on my account. (You will need to set up a GitHub account if you do not already have one.)
    * Written solutions must be submitted as PDF documents or Jupyter Notebooks.
    * Problem sets will be due on the day listed in the Daily Course Schedule section of this syllabus (see below) unless otherwise specified. Late problem sets will not receive any credit. Partially completed problem sets will receive partial credit.

* **Exam & Quizzes:**
    * We may periodically have in-class quizzes as low-stakes ways to get feedback
    * There will be an oral final exam, but no midterm exams

* **Final Project:**
    * Collect data on and analyze a research question of your choosing, using methods taught in this course
    * Write up a ~10 page (12pt font, double spaced, excluding References, Figures, and Tables) summary of your findings, including discussion about what prior studies of the same topic have found, as well as citations to prior studies
    * Turn in the written summary report and a GitHub repository containing all materials required to reproduce the results
    * Summary report should be written in LaTeX or RMarkdown and turned in as a PDF (source code for the summary report should also be included in your GitHub repository)
    * An example of what the final product should look like is [here](https://raw.githack.com/tyleransom/DScourseS26/master/FinalProject/ExampleProject.pdf), with LaTeX source code [here](https://github.com/tyleransom/DScourseS26/blob/master/FinalProject/ExampleProject.tex) and BibTeX source code [here](https://github.com/tyleransom/DScourseS26/blob/master/FinalProject/References.bib).
    * A detailed rubric for the final project is [here](https://github.com/tyleransom/DScourseS26/blob/master/FinalProject/README.md)

## Communication ##

* I will always be available via email, and via Zoom during office hours. Zoom link for office hours will be posted on Canvas.

### Emergency Protocol ###

During an emergency, there are official university procedures that will maximize your safety.

**Severe Weather:** If you receive an OU Alert to seek refuge or hear a tornado siren that signals severe weather:

1. Look for severe weather refuge location maps located inside most OU buildings near the entrances.
2. Seek refuge inside a building. Do not leave one building to seek shelter in another building that you deem safer. If outside, get into the nearest building.
3. Go to the building's severe weather refuge location. If you do not know where that is, go to the lowest level possible and seek refuge in an innermost room. Avoid outside doors and windows.
4. Get in, Get Down, Cover Up
5. Wait for official notice to resume normal activities.

Additional Weather Safety Information is available through the [Department of Campus Safety](https://www.ou.edu/police).

### The University of Oklahoma Active Threat Guidance ###

The University of Oklahoma embraces a Run, Hide, Fight strategy for active threats on campus. This strategy is well known, widely accepted, and proven to save lives. To receive emergency campus alerts, be sure to update your contact information and preferences in the account settings section at one.ou.edu.

**RUN:** Running away from the threat is usually the best option. If it is safe to run, run as far away from the threat as possible. Call 911 when you are in a safe location and let them know from which OU campus you're calling from and location of active threat.

**HIDE:** If running is not practical, the next best option is to hide. Lock and barricade all doors; turn off all lights; turn down your phone's volume; search for improvised weapons; hide behind solid objects and walls; and hide yourself completely and stay quiet. Remain in place until law enforcement arrives. Be patient and remain hidden.

**FIGHT:** If you are unable to run or hide, the last best option is to fight. Have one or more improvised weapons with you and be prepared to attack. Attack them when they are least expecting it and hit them where it hurts most: the face (specifically eyes, nose, and ears), the throat, the diaphragm (solar plexus), and the groin.

Please save OUPD's contact information in your phone:
* **NORMAN campus:** For non-emergencies call (405) 325-1717. For emergencies call (405) 325-1911 or dial 911.
* **TULSA campus:** For non-emergencies call (918) 660-3900. For emergencies call (918) 660-3333 or dial 911.

### Fire Alarm/General Emergency ###

If you receive an OU Alert that there is danger inside or near the building, or the fire alarm inside the building activates:

1. LEAVE the building. Do not use the elevators.
2. KNOW at least two building exits
3. ASSIST those that may need help
4. PROCEED to the emergency assembly area
5. ONCE safely outside, NOTIFY first responders of anyone that may still be inside building due to mobility issues.
6. WAIT for official notice before attempting to re-enter the building.

[OU Fire Safety on Campus](https://www.ou.edu/police/fire)

### Academic Integrity ###

I do not tolerate academic misconduct, [and neither does the University of Oklahoma](http://integrity.ou.edu/files/nine_things_you_should_know.pdf). I will not hesitate to fail students who do not fully comply with the University's academic misconduct policy. If you find yourself contemplating cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic misconduct, please come see me first. Help is available if you are struggling. I want everyone in the class to try their best and to do their own work. Please be advised that I reserve the right to utilize anti-plagiarism resources such as TurnItIn when grading assignments.
